# coyote-package-system
An unofficial package system for the now discontinued Coyote Linux

This has been uploaded here for archival purposes. Coyote Linux development is long dead, as is this project.
The commit dates will reflect when they were pushed to github, not when I originally created them as I wasn't using any version control system at the time.

I have done a commit for each version change I have available for completion sake.
