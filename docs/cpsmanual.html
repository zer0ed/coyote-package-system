<h3>Installing CPS</h3>
<p>CPS is installed on your Coyote router via an easy to install patch! You must 
  have Coyote Linux already installed and running to install CPS! It's suggested 
  that you make a backup (2nd disk) of your Coyote disk before you patch it! When 
  your ready, follow the steps below..</p>
<ol>
  <li>Obtain the latest version of CPS from the <a href="http://www.routerdesign.com">Router 
    Design Project</a> website.</li>
  <li>Unzip it's contents onto a blank floppy disk (in this example we'll use 
    a 1.44 MS-DOS formatted disk)</li>
  <li>Place the disk with CPS into the Coyote machine.</li>
  <li>Mount the disk (mount /dev/fd0u1440 /mnt)</li>
  <li>Change to the floppy directory (cd /mnt)</li>
  <li>Run the patch file (./patch)</li>
  <li>Use the appropriate menu options</li>
  <li>After you have installed CPS and quit out of the patch menu, get out of 
    the floppy directory (cd)</li>
  <li>Now un-mount the floppy (umount /mnt) and remove your CPS disk (you don't 
    need it anymore)</li>
  <li>Place the Coyote disk back in the drive and run backup!</li>
</ol>

    floppy is used)</li>
