     Important note from the CPS Development Team
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
     Please note that this patch is for Coyote Linux v1.40 series routers
    only!  For Coyote Linux v1.32 series or earlier versions, please visit
    the CPS website @ http://www.routerdesign.com/cps.php
    
     As of this release (Feb 20, 2003) CPS v0.7b is the only patch to work
    with Coyote Linux v1.32 or earlier.  Please check the above mentioned
    website because we plan to release CPS v1.0 in the future which will
    support both v1.3x and 1.4x series routers.
    
     This version of CPS is just a quick solution to those of you that want
    to use pre-release versions of Coyote Linux 1.4x.  As of this writing
    the latest Coyote is v1.40 RC1.  This version of CPS is for testing
    purposes only and will not be fully supported.  It was quickly put
    together by the CPS Devel Team as a solution for those of you running
    Coyote Linux v1.40 RC1 (and any other pre-releases).
    
    The CPS Devel Team  has no intention in releasing a new version of CPS
    until Coyote Linux v1.40 is in it's final release!
    
     Thanks to Rusty Martin [omega_monk] for applying the "quick fix"
    to CPS so it will run on Coyote Linux v1.4x series routers.
